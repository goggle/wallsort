# The base categoryectory of the images
directory = "/home/alex/test"

# Different categories of images can be specified with a [[category]] entry.
# Valid key arguments are:
# name:         The name of this category (string).
# height:       The height of the image (in pixels). It can either be a
#               integer or an array of two integers, in which case it specifies
#               a range of valid image heights (the second element is
#               interpreted as inclusive).
# width:        The width of the image (in pixels). As above, this can be
#               specified as an array of two integer values.
# min_pixels:   The minimum amount of pixels in the image.
# max_pixels:   The maximum amount of pixels in the image.
#
# Each category needs to have a name to be valid.
# It might be a good idea to have a category which only contains a name tag,
# so it is guaranteed that every image in the base categoryectory satisfies the
# conditions of at least one category.
# Earlier defined categories have precedence.
